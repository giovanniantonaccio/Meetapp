    Meetapp API
</h1>

This APP is the final challenge of [Rocketseat Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/bootcamp). The objective is to create an application for meetups, where people can create new meetups or subscribe to the existing ones. The organizers will manage their events through a web application using ReactJS. People who just need to subscribe to the events will do this through a mobile app developed using React Native. Both applications will consume data from a Rest API developed with NodeJS and Express.
